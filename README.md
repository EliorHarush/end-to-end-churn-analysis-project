# End-to-End-Churn-Analysis-Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer churn analysis workflow, covering data preparation, predictive modeling, and business-focused visualization. The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning and surface actionable insights that can support retention strategies.

The project combines SQL Server, Python (scikit-learn), and Power BI to reflect a realistic analytics pipeline from raw data to decision-ready outputs.
